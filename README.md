# Semantic DevOps Bot

## Overview
An AI-powered DevOps assistant that reads error logs, suggests fixes, and automatically creates GitHub issues. Built with Microsoft Semantic Kernel and AutoGen.

## Architecture
The system uses a multi-agent approach where different specialized agents communicate through memory-linked, language-based prompts:
- **AnalyzerAgent**: Processes log files to identify error patterns
- **IssueWriterAgent**: Formulates clear GitHub issues from analysis
- **ReasoningAgent**: Provides context and potential solutions

## Key Features
- Batch processing of production logs
- Error pattern detection and classification
- Automatic GitHub issue generation with context
- Memory-linked agent communication
- OpenAI GPT-4 integration for reasoning

## Technology Stack
- Microsoft AutoGen
- Microsoft Semantic Kernel
- OpenAI GPT-4
- PyGitHub
- Python

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bblackheart013/semantic-devops-bot.git
cd semantic-devops-bot
pip install -r requirements.txt

from semantic_devops.core import LogAnalyzer

analyzer = LogAnalyzer("path/to/logs")
issues = analyzer.process()
Microsoft Collaboration
```

#This project was developed under mentorship from Microsoft Engineers, leveraging the latest in agent-based AI systems design.

##Future Roadmap
- Slack integration
- Streaming log hooks
- Azure-based observability
- Autonomous resolution suggestions
